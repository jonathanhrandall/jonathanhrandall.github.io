# CS371p Spring 2022: Jonathan Randall

**What did you do this past week?** 

Coming back from Spring Break was jarring, to say the least! Here are my recaps, separated by course.
- Data Mining
    - We covered two clustering algorithms: k-means and DBSCAN, which is a density-based clustering algorithm.

- Big Data
    - We covered graph processing, from GraphX to Pregel.
    - I worked on a project where we implemented PageRank, but using the GraphFrame library. We used the `MessageAggregation` module to update vertices, which is more efficient than the `groupBy` and `join` operations needed if we treated the website vertices as raw DataFrames.

- OOP
    - We discussed ideas relevant to the `Allocator` project.

**What's in your way?**

I need to finish up `Allocator`. Coalescing multiple free blocks in the `deallocate()` function is non-trivial, but I'm confident that I can figure it out.

**What will you do next week?**

Tomorrow, I will finish `Allocator` and write additional unit tests and acceptance tests. On Tuesday, I will finish my Big Data assignment.

**What did you think of Paper #9: Dependency Inversion Principle?**

I still don't see what exactly is being inverted. Most of the examples discussed using abstract classes, upon which lower level modules depended.

**What was your experience of DigitsIterator, Iterators, and std::vector? (this question will vary, week to week)**

It brought me back to creating a `DigitsIterator` in Python for SWE. Clearly, pointers and pointer arithmetic served as the guiding aesthetic principle for iterators in c++. It can, however, be confusing to conflate the `*` operator with accessing an iterator's current element. There is a sense in which the `*` operator feels overloaded.

**What made you happy this week?**

I went to Barton Springs today. The weather's getting hot!

**What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

My pick-of-the-week has to be the `argparse` module in Python. If you're like me, you were using `sys.argv[]` to access command-line arguments blindly. It provides the user with additional context for each argument, and allows the programmer to mandate arguments without exception handling.
