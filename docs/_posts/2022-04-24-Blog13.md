# CS371p Spring 2022: Jonathan Randall

**What did you do this past week?** 

- Data Mining
    - My project group is working to predict outcomes for animals in the Austin Animal Services system, based on their features upon intake. The data exploration phase let us in on a weird fact: many bats get into the system at AAS. And, Austin prides itself on being a "no-kill" city meaning that euthanasia is considered a bad outcome for cats and dogs. However, many bats are euthanized. This is probably because very few people can adopt bats, but it's still sad.
- Big Data
    - My group worked on performing a machine learning task in a distributed fashion using PyTorch's "Distributed Data Parallel" module. We also successfuly used Torchserve to provide an API for classifying images.
- OOP
    - We did many exercises this week. We talked about "Life."

**What's in your way?**

Life. The project, and in general. I need to plan for graduation as well.

**What will you do next week?**

Next week, I will start on "Life." I haven't looked at the specifications, but I can imagine reusing some code from Darwin. We will have to use inheritance for this project, so I hope to read up on abstract classes and virtual functions in C++.

**What did you think of Paper 13. What Happens to Us Does Not Happen to Most of You?**

I remember this paper from a previous semester. It is upsetting how pervasive sex-based discrimination and harassment is in academia and the tech sector. The paper is a reminder that it is not enough to be a bystander; we must actively promote inclusion and equity. Of course, this applies to all stakeholders in software development, from our coworkers, to our supervisors, to customers and to society in general.

**What was your experience of r-value references, move constructor, and move assignment? (this question will vary, week to week)**

I am curious as to how the "move" function works under-the-hood, but this would likely require looking at various compiler implemenations. Perhaps that is the best way to truly understand C++. After all, when I parse code now, I am guessing as to what a compiler would do. My guesses are getting better over time. But to truly understand C++, I must become the compiler.

**What made you happy this week?**

I attended my friend's thesis presentation. Another friend from Chicago visited. It's been great!

**What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

My tip of the week is Data Mining-related. I have enjoyed using Pandas `get_dummies()` function to one-hot-encode variables. I prefer it over `sklearn` functions such as `Label Binarizer` or the `One Hot Encode` module, since Pandas allows you to easily label and prefix column names with the original column.
