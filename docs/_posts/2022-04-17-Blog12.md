# CS371p Spring 2022: Jonathan Randall

**What did you do this past week?** 

- Data Mining
    - We took an exam on clustering and anomaly detection. Some of the questions asked us to imagine what clustering algorithms would do on example datasets (visualized via 2-dimensional scatter plots). I find this difficult.
    - Our project group started on a classification test. We are trying to predict outcomes at the Austin Animal Center, e.g. whether the animals were adopted, transfered, etc, based on features like their age, breed, etc.

- Big Data
    - We are toying with data-parallel processing in PyTorch across a cluster of machines. The idea behind data-parallel processing is that forward prop on part of a mini-batch of training examples occurs on a single machine, with the segments of the mini-batches given to different machines.

- OOP
    - `Darwin` left me feeling unsatisfied. I really wanted to make `Instruction` generalizable, so that one could declare arbitrary instructions (using inheritance). In this dream, all of the information on how to update Creatures and their adjacent space should be inside of `Instruction`.
    - I realized we don't have exams in this class only this week. I was waiting for an exam.

**What's in your way?**

Projects in Big Data and Data Mining stand before me.

**What will you do next week?**

I will work with my group in Data Mining. I will work with my group in Big Data. I will clean my house. I will try to do some watercolor.

**What did you think of Paper 12. Why extends is evil?**

The primary grievance aired rested on derived classes invoking an overridden function, and that function calling a non-virtual function in their parent class. However, having function implementations in base classes seems useful in some circumstances. If we know a function will be implemented identically in all derived classes of a class, won't this lead to redundancy?

**What was your experience of iteration, initializations, and vector? (this question will vary, week to week)**

Everything's making sense. But where do allocators come in? We are still calling zero-argument constructors `n` times when building an array.

**What made you happy this week?**

I went to brunch today. I have been watching Breaking Bad. It's pretty good.

**What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

My pick-of-the-week is this [paper describing the Verified Software Toolchain](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/vst.pdf) developed to build reliable software systems that is provably correct.
