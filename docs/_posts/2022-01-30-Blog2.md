# CS371p Spring 2022: Jonathan Randall

**What did you do this past week?** 

I forked and started looking at Collatz. In my Big Data course, my group started and completed an assignment which mostly involved installing HDFS and Spark. Outside of school, I tried to get my cracked phone camera lens fixed; replacing the entire phone ended up being cheaper. Building hardware that's more expensive to fix than toss out and replace is a bad design decision and is not resource efficient.

**What's in your way?**

I am figuring out my sleep schedule. It's irregular.

**What will you do next week?**

This upcoming week, I will tackle Collatz.

**What did you think of Paper #1: Syllabus?**

It's clear enough. I probably won't check my grades as obsessively this semester since I graduate in May. Nearing the end of every semester, I typically enter spirals of stress as I try to determine whether I will meet my academic goals. I plan to focus more on the work itself and instructor feedback rather than fretting about percentages, and the new grading system seems compatible with that plan.

**What was your experience of assertions and Collatz? (this question will vary, week to week)**

Assertions work the same as how I would expect. In SWE, I completed the Collatz project in Python and found it interesting, although not particularly challening. The most difficult aspect of this project will be getting familiar with C++, its syntax and its built-in types.

**What made you happy this week?**

I watched "Gummo" and "Titane," two movies I have had on my watchlist for a while.

**What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**

My tip-of-the-week would be remote development with SSH in VS Code. Using the file explorer interface is faster for file lookup, opening and editing files (I'm a vim amateur), and moving files than bash commands.
