# CS371p Spring 2022: Jonathan Randall

**What did you do this past week?**
- I finished Collatz. I worked on some assignments in my Data Mining course. In preparation for the winter weather, I bought food and water bottles. Then, when the winter weather turned out to be not too bad, I felt like I had overprepared. Then, when the City of Austin declared its third "boil notice" in four years, I felt underprepared again!

**What's in your way?**
- I'm a little behind in my Big Data course. In this course, I'm looking for instructions for adding graders to the GitLab repo, which aren't anywhere I've checked.

**What will you do next week?**
- Next week, I will try to refine my understanding of types in C++.

**What did you think of Paper #3: Continuos Integration?**
- I haven't checked it out yet.

**What was your experience of UnitTests, Coverage, and IsPrime? (this question will vary, week to week)**
- IsPrime was a great toy problem that led me to think about optimizations. I still don't understand how to make coverage reports beautiful to view. I believe VS Code has some extension that when used with gcov will generate beautiful, line by line feedback.

**What made you happy this week?**
- I went to San Antonio. It's a shame about the Alamo.

**What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
- My tip-of-the-week for my VS Code users is (this Doxygen Documentation generator.)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cschlosser.doxdocgen]
